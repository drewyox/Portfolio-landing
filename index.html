      <h1>Drew Yoxsimer's Portfolio</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>This is my portfolio. While I might not have a lot to show right now, I've learned so much in this first week. I will continue to to expand my knowledge and continue to add new and exciting creations to my portfolio.<p>

      <em><h2>About Me</h2></em>
      <p>I grew up in California, and moved all around Northern California. Most recently though, I lived in Santa Cruz California after I graduated from the University of Oregon. I lived there for about 3 years after graduating and moved to Portland in early 2018.</p>
      <p>After school I helped my father and a mutual friend start a business. In the early days of our project, we had no one to handle coding and tech for our rudimentary and outsourced website. I taught myself the basics of html and css in order to help out. This was my first experience with coding, and I really liked it! Unfortunately I was unable to pursue it at all until nearly three and a half years later with epicodus!</p>
      <p>For fun, I like to play music on the bass, drums, and guitar, sculpt, and play video games. I've played quite a few instruments over the years including piano and saxophone, but the three I've listed before are my main staples. My favorite form to sculpt is the hand, because I think its one ofthe most expressive parts of the body. Some of my all time favorite video games are anything belonging to the Dark Souls/Bloodborne franchise and more recently fighting games like Injustice 2, Soul Calibur VI, and Mortal Kombat X.

          <p> This is perhaps my favorite site I have done so far. This<span class="bg-info"> Dream Vacation Site</span> is one of the first sites I made utilizing <strong>bootstraps</strong> shortcuts and helpful snippets of code. Its apparent in the design that using <strong>bootstrap</strong> can be a great shortcut. However, the next example of my work demonstrates what can happen when using <strong>bootstrap</strong> goes too far.</p>

          <p>The<span class="bg-info"> Cupcake Website </span>was, at the time one of the cleanest sites I had made so far. This was prior to <strong>bootstraps</strong> introduction, and it shows. The main focus for my partner Dana and me was to have a very functional site with working links and a clear layout. We didn't try and get too fancy with the css and instead chose to focus on the basics.</p>

          <p>During this<span class="bg-info"> Wikipedia Project </span>, I was a little fixated on using <strong>bootstrap</strong> for every css function. I did not realize I should pick and choose what I wanted from <strong>bootstrap</strong> while giving myself the custom css I needed in my own styles sheet. This is probably my worst looking and most frustrating to build website, but this was also one of my greatest learning moments. After completing this site, I made another branch, called restart, using a blend of my own css and the <strong>bootstrap</strong> file. Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/drewyox/wiki-build/tree/restart">repository</a></p>

            <p>I had quite a lot of fun on this<span class="bg-info"> Island Resort </span>project. My partner Jared and I wanted to just go crazy with the css elements. It was almost an opposite mindset to the cupcake shop project. We both felt solid on the lesson objectives and decided to make a crazy looking funny site without worrying too much about how it actually looked as a cohesive website</p>
