      <p></p>
      <p>This is my portfolio. While I might not have a lot to show right now, I've learned so much in this first week. I will continue to to expand my knowledge and continue to add new and exciting creations to my portfolio.<p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I grew up in California, but went to school at the University of Oregon South of Portland in Eugene.</p>
      <p>After school I helped my father and a mutual friend start a business called Borrowshare. The idea of the company was airbnb for your stuff. You could rent out your belongings to your neighbors, strengthening community bonds, reducing waste through re-use of items, and serving as a small income source for those who needed it. In the early days of our project, we had no one to handle coding and tech for our rudimentary website. I taught myself the basics of html and css through codecademy in order to help out our company. Later, when we started working with a man named Dominic Merenda, he suggested I pursue coding more seriously. At the time I didn't think much of it, but two and a half years later I decided to follow up on that and attend Epicodus!</p>

          <p> This is perhaps my favorite site I have done so far. It is one of the first sites I made utilizing bootstraps shortcuts and helpful snippets of code. Its apparent in the design that using bootstrap can be a great shortcut. However, the next example of my work demonstrates what can happen when using bootstrap goes too far.</p>

          <p>The cupcake website was, at the time one of the cleanest sites I had made so far. This was prior to bootstraps introduction, and it shows. The main focus for my partner Dana and me was to have a very functional site with working links and a clear layout. We didn't try and get too fancy with the css and instead chose to focus on the basics.</p>

          <p>During this wikipedia project, I was a little fixated on using bootstrap for every css function. I did not realize I should pick and choose what I wanted from bootstrap while giving myself the custom css I needed in my own styles sheet. This is probably my worst looking and most frustrating to build website, but this was also one of my greatest learning moments. After completing this site, I made another branch, called restart, using a blend of my own css and the bootstrap file. Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/drewyox/wiki-build/tree/restart">repository</a></p>

            <p>I had quite a lot of fun on this project. My partner Jared and I wanted to just go crazy with the css elements. It was almost an opposite mindset to the cupcake shop project. We both felt solid on the lesson objectives and decided to make a crazy looking funny site without worrying too much about how it actually looked as a cohesive website</p>
